# EORSSD-dataset
Extended Optical Remote Sensing Saliency Detection (EORSSD) Dataset

To enhance the size and variety of the dataset, we extend our ORSSD dataset to a larger one named Eetended ORSSD (EORSSD) dataset with 2,000 images and corresponding pixel-wise ground truth, which includes many semantically meaningful but challenging images.
